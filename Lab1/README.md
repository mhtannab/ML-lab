In this lab, I followed the manual to deepen my understanding of machine learning workflows and dataset management.
For this lab, I practiced identifying the machine learning problem and preparing the project structure for the Gold Futures Price Prediction Dataset:

1.Problem Identification: Classified the task as a Regression problem, as the goal is to predict the continuous numerical value of gold prices.

2.Dataset Selection: Selected an open dataset, specifically using clean_price_data.csv, which contains historical market indicators.

3.Target Definition: Defined the target variable as the Gold Price, which the model is expected to learn and predict.

I used several tools to complete the workflow:
1-Visual Studio Code: Used it as my primary editor for managing the repository and writing scripts.
2-Jupyter Notebooks: Created a .ipynb file to load the dataset using Pandas, displaying its shape and previewing the first few rows to ensure data integrity.
3-GitHub Desktop : Used this visual interfave to manage Push and Pull requests.
