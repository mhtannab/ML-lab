# Bank Customer Churn - (EDA)

## Overview
This project performs a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the **Bank Churners** dataset. The goal is to identify patterns in customer behavior and find key factors that influence whether a customer stays with the bank or leaves (attrition).

### Key Insights
* **Retention Rate:** Approximately **83.9%** of customers are active, while **16.1%** have churned.
* **Demographics:** The average customer age is **46 years**, with the majority falling between 40 and 50.
* **Loyalty by Card Tier:** Interestingly, **Silver card holders** show the highest retention rate (~85%), followed by Blue card holders.
* **Gender Trends:** Male customers have a slightly higher retention rate (**85.3%**) compared to female customers (**82.6%**).
* **Activity:** A strong positive relationship exists between transaction frequency/amount and customer retention.

## Visualizations Included
1. **Retention Rate by Card Category:** Comparison of loyalty across card tiers.
2. **Retention Rate by Gender:** Breakdown of churn by gender.
